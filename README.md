# QA-practice-manual
Manual QA practice from scratch

## Application under test
Mercado Libre (Web)

## Feature
Product Search

## Objective
Analyze the product search functionality from a QA perspective.

## Observations
- The search bar is visible on the main page.
- When entering a product name and pressing Enter, a results page is displayed.
- The first section shows related searches and does not interfere with the main results.
- The left section contains filters. One of the first filters displayed is "Category", which shows general store categories rather than product-specific categories.
- The main section displays sorting options (e.g., price) followed by product cards including image and price.

## Initial QA Questions
- What happens if the search field is empty?
- What happens if special characters are used?
- Is there a limit on search input length?
- Are results consistent for similar search terms?
